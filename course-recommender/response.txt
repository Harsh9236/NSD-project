Okay, I've reviewed the resume and compared it to the desired "Backend Engineer" role. Here's my assessment and skills recommendations:

**Assessment:**

The resume is very strong for a Frontend Engineer role. The candidate has a solid history of frontend development experience, a diverse skillset in frontend technologies, and a portfolio of relevant projects. However, the resume is heavily geared towards frontend development and lacks significant evidence of backend skills and experience. To successfully transition to a Backend Engineer role, the candidate needs to demonstrate backend proficiency.

**Skills to Develop (based on the resume and desired role):**

Given the resume's frontend focus, here's what the candidate should prioritize in terms of skill development for a Backend Engineer role:

*   **Backend Languages:** <Python>, <Java>, <Node.js (Express.js)>, <Go>, <C#>. (The specific language depends on the targeted backend roles and the company's tech stack).
*   **Backend Frameworks:** <Spring>, <NestJS>, <Django>, <Flask>, <Ruby on Rails>, <ASP.NET>. Again, this depends on the target roles.
*   **Databases:** <SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)>, <NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)>.
*   **Cloud Technologies:** <AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)>, <Azure>, <Google Cloud Platform (GCP)>.
*   **API Design and Development:**  <RESTful APIs>, <GraphQL>, <gRPC>, <API Security>, <API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)>.
*   **DevOps:** <Docker>, <Kubernetes>, <CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)>, <Terraform/CloudFormation>.
*   **Testing:** <Unit Testing (backend frameworks specific)>, <Integration Testing>, <End-to-End Testing>.
*   **Operating Systems:** <Linux>, <server administration>.
*   **Message Queues:** <Kafka>, <RabbitMQ>, <AWS SQS>.
*   **Microservices Architecture**. Includes an understanding of inter-service communication and related design patterns.
*   **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Strengthen fundamental knowledge in this area as it's crucial for backend optimization.
*   **Security**: <OWASP principles>, backend specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Version Control**: Version control is in the resume, but you need a deep understanding of <Git branching strategies> to work efficiently in a larger team
